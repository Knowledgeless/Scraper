# Scraper

Actually it is a combine script of different 3 scripts of mine. But, there some bug has been fixed. You can scrap your required data from a website using this. You can download these things,

- PDF
- Images
- Links

To use this script you have to installed some required module. Those are given below,

- pip & pip3
- tqdm
- requests
- bs4 

Because of it's a python script, it's not make any sense that you maust have to installed <h3>python3</h3>. But if you get some unknow errors which I forgot to handle, please let me know. I will try to fix them.

To use this scipt, just run this on your terminal,
<h3> - python3 scraper.py </h3>

You can use this script on your mobile phone too. To do that you have to installed an additional software from playstore named 'termux'. After completing the installion process, follow the procudure has given bellow. 

- Go to the settings > apps > termux > permission 
- check the permission for your memory card storage. 
- after that run termux and type 'cd sdcard' or 'cd storage'
- excess your folder using 'cd folder_name' 

run these command after approching your selected folder 

- 'pkg install git'

Install all the packages I have written about at the top. Just use 'pkg install module_name'. After get installed all the required things now run <h3> 'git clone https://github.com/Knowledgeless/Scraper.git' </h3>. It will download this script. Now you know how to access the folder. Command 'cd folder_name'. 
Now run this command,

- python3 scraper.py

<h2>Bingo! </h2>
<h2>HaveFun<h2>
