# Scraper
<hr>
Actually it is a combine script of different 3 scripts of mine. You can scrap your required data from a website using this. You can download these things,

- PDF
- Images
- Links

To use this script you have to installed some required module. Those are given below,

- pip & pip3
- tqdm
- requests
- bs4 

Because of it's a python script, it's not make any sense that you maust have to installed python. But if you get some unknow errors, then just let me know. I will try to fix them.

To use this scipt, just run this command,
<h3> - python3 scraper.py </h3>
